# VR-Meditation

My app shows the user a VR-compatible menu system that allows them to set a timer, pause/change the timer, choose between virtual environments, and select a background noise. I created the app inside the Unity game engine, which lets me load the app on my own headset.


### Description

You can see a full demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/wIvLSiQN_yY).

I began meditating four years ago, and it has had a huge effect on my mental health and my ability to be present. After getting myself an Oculus Quest, I downloaded every meditation application I could find.

To my disappointment, these apps were much too complicated, with intricate visuals and longwinded guided meditations. Instead of complaining, I made my own simple meditation app for myself.

Once the chosen amount of time passes, a bell rings to signal the end of the meditation. I always walk away from my virtual meditations feeling more focused and less stressed.
